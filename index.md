I am is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Echizen Lab](https://research.nii.ac.jp/~iechizen/official/index-e.html), National Institute of Informatics (NII). I received my Ph.D. degree from the [State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IOTSC)](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/) of University of Macau, under the supervision of Prof. [Jiantao Zhou]((https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/jtzhou/)). My primary research interests include adversarial attack methods and privacy-preserving technologies, as well as security and privacy issues across various areas of artificial intelligence.

I obtained both my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Software Engineering from Beihang University. After completing my master’s degree, I worked for two years at Tencent Shenzhen, where I focused on data analysis and machine learning modeling for financial risk control.

Researchers and students who are interested in my research topics are very welcome to get in touch for discussion and collaboration.
